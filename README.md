# Stratagem

Implement Algorithms and Data-Structures to experience how Open-Source Community works

## Tasks:

- Write new algorithms.
- Improve existing ones.
- Improve the Repo.

## Rules:

- Create Issue, mention if you are interested to work on it and get it assigned.
- Create PR with heading "Fixes #Issue_No: the the heading".
- Maintain a commit per feature and a PR shall solve one issue.
- Get the PR reviewed by peers and fix them according to __request changes__.
- Be polite to other co-developers. Any maltreatment will get you kicked off.
- Review peers' PRs are suggest them how the PR can be improved.
- Code in respective directories according to the language you choose. Create new one if the programming language isn't present.
